"""Reviewer point #3: a sign-flip (randomisation) test on the 28 paired
per-origin differences, as a distribution-free alternative to the sign
test that does not throw away the magnitude of each difference.

H0: the sign of each origin's (lambda=0.95 - control) difference is an
independent fair coin flip, i.e. decay has no consistent directional
effect. Under H0, the distribution of the mean difference is symmetric
under independently flipping the sign of each of the 28 observed
differences. We enumerate this exactly when feasible (2**28 is too large,
so we Monte Carlo with a large number of random sign patterns) and report
the two-sided p-value as the fraction of |permuted mean| >= |observed mean|.
