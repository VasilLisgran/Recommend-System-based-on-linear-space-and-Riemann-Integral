"""Reviewer point #2: does a within-account (stratified) block bootstrap
give a materially different interval from the pooled bootstrap that lets
blocks straddle the u2/u3 boundary?

The pooled bootstrap in chrono_split.py concatenates the 13 u2 differences
and 15 u3 differences into one 28-element series and draws blocks from it,
so a small number of blocks mix one account's tail with the other account's
head. This script instead draws blocks separately within each account's own
series (never crossing the boundary), concatenates the two account-specific
resamples, and reports the resulting percentile CI for comparison, at every
block length used in the paper (1-4).
